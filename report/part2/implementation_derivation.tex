\chapter{Derivation and Implementation}
In this chapter composite materials modelling in coupled fields is investigated. First we extend computational homogenization of composite material to coupled field problems, which involves the calculation of fluctuation of coupled fields, averaged quantities and effective tangent moduli. Theses tasks are done by the current unit cell module. In the module energy based formulation is exploited. In this context the material model is easy to generate and the equilibrium is also easy to establish. The considered materials are Neo-Hookean type materials (may contain magnetic or electrical energy) and the composites containing periodic micro structures.

Details of the problem setting and derivation are presented in the following two sections. Then some issues in implementation are shortly discussed. The source code and user documentation are clarified in the end of this chapter.

\section{Problem Setting}
The discussion focuses on unit cells consisting of multiple materials. A unit cell can be two dimensional or three dimensional, usually a square or a cube with edge length one. Each material component occupies a range of domain in the cell, which are inclusions. All the inclusions possess no intersections in the domain. Multiple fields can be taken into account, such as mechanical field, temperature field and electrical field. Material types are hyperelastic material, thermomechanical Simo-Pister material (introduced in the course Elements of Non-linear Continuum Thermodynamics) and Neo-Hookean electroactive material. The energy function of electroactive material is extracted from the literature \citep{keip_two-scale_2014}. All the materials in the current material library share the common feature, i.e. no dissipative. Plasticity and viscosity are beyond the scope of the current work.

The energy functions used are summarized below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textbf{Saint Venant-Kirchhoff Material} \citep{marsden_mathematical_1994}
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: svk}
	\psi\left( \mathbf{E} \right) = \dfrac{\lambda}{2} \left[ \text{tr}(\mathbf{E}) \right]^{2} + \mu \text{tr} \left( \mathbf{E}^{2} \right),
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathbf{E}$ is Green Lagrange Tensor.
	
	\item[] \textbf{Simo Pister Material} \citep{wriggers_coupled_1992}
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: sp mat}
	\psi\left( \theta, \mathbf{C} \right) = \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0} \left( I_{C}-3 \right) + \frac{1}{2} \lambda_{0} \left[ \ln \left( \det \mathbf{C} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \right]^{2} + \left( m_{0}\Delta \theta \mu_{0}\right) \ln (\det \mathbf{C})^{\frac{1}{2}} - \rho_{0} c_{V} \left( \theta \ln\dfrac{\theta}{\theta_{0}} - \Delta \theta \right),
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathbf{C}$ is right Cauchy-Green tensor, $\theta$ is temperature.
	
	\item[] \textbf{Neo-Hookean Type Electroactive Material} \citep{keip_two-scale_2014} 

	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: nhk}
	\psi\left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{E} \right) =  \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0} \left( \text{tr}[\mathbf{C}]-3 \right) + \dfrac{\lambda}{4} \left( J^{2}-1 \right) - \left( \dfrac{\lambda}{2} + \mu \right) \ln J - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{0} \left( 1+\dfrac{\chi}{J} \right) J \left[ \mathbf{C}^{-1}: (\mathbf{E} \otimes \mathbf{E}) \right],
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathbf{C}$ is right Cauchy-Green tensor, $\mathbf{E}$ is electric field intensity.
	
\end{itemize}

%where $\mathbf{E}$ is the Green-Lagrange tensor, while $\mathbf{C}$ right Cauchy-Green tensor. Notice that $\theta$ represents temperature in the second material law and $\mathbf{E}$ in the third material is electric field intensity other than the right Cauchy-Green tensor.

\section{Derivation}
In this section the derivation concerning the unit cell problem as well as a scheme for the calculation of the effective tangent moduli are presented. We first formulate the total energy of composite materials, then derive equilibrium from the obtained total energy. Solving the equilibrium will give fluctuation in the micro scale. At last calculation of effective quantities is performed, which will be required for the macro scale problem.

Motivated by the ideas from \citep{miehe_homogenization_2016}, a compact representation of field variables is presented. We denote $\mathbf{w}$ as an extended displacement, which comprises the traditional displacement in mechanical problem as well as extra virtual displacements in other fields, such as temperature $T$ for the temperature field. Accordingly the strain in traditional mechanical problem should be regarded as an extended strain tensor measure here with notation $\mathbf{F}$. The extended stress can be defined in the same manner. It should be noticed that we use a slightly different notation from the one introduced in the literature \citep{miehe_homogenization_2016} (namely without star as superscript), which is for the purpose of consistency with the implementation. We performed an additive split in the extended displacement and the extended deformation. These two parts are respectively the averaged quantity from macro scale, $\overbar{(\cdot)}$, and the fluctuation, $\widetilde{(\cdot)}$ from micro scale, which is to be solved. This relation is stated as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: decomp}
\mathbf{w} = \overbar{\mathbf{w}} + \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}, \ \mathbf{F} = \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}.
\end{equation}

The macro and micro deformation decomposition can be viewed in the following figure,
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \label{fig: mima}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../pics/mima.png}
  \caption{macro and micro deformation decomposition}
\end{figure}

One advantage of this notion is that there is then no need to treat the variable separately in the derivation. Besides the merged function feature in FEniCS can be employed. It is then not necessary to derive the coupled terms in stiffness matrix. All the coupled terms in stiffness matrix is calculated implicitly and automatically.

\subsection{Total Energy}
For composites total energy is the sum of energy from every component plus their interface energy (not accounted in the current formulation). There are two different representations of the total energy. One is used to derive equilibrium. Hence the dependency in energy is the corresponding extended displacement. The other is for the calculation of extended stress and tangent moduli. In this case the total energy should be expressed with the extended strain. Using the notation given above, these two types of total energy are stated as follows (assume there are $n$ different materials in this composite). First the original presentation of energy using the extended strain is given as (here viscosity and plasticity not accounted) 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: strain energy}
\Pi(\mathbf{F}) = \hat{\Pi}(\overbar{\mathbf{F}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation}
As the extended strain is actually a function of the extended displacement, meaning $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{F}(\overbar{\mathbf{w}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{w}})$, the total energy can be represented as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: disp energy}
\Pi(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w})) =\Pi(\mathbf{F}(\overbar{\mathbf{w}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{w}})) =  \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w})) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Equilibrium}
The equilibrium of the system in a unit cell is built around the stationary point of its total energy with respect to the fluctuation,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: equ}
\dfrac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w}))}{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}} = \mathbf{0}.
\end{equation}
Above might be a non-linear equation. It is assumed that Newton method is used (other non-linear solvers are also possible). Therefore the Jacobian of this equation is needed. Denoting $\widetilde{\mathbf{v}}$ as the test function for the fluctuation, $\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{inc}}$ as the incremental trial function in a Newton step, the weak form of (\ref{eq: equ}) and Jacobian can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: bi and li}
L = \dfrac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w}))}{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}} \cdot \widetilde{\mathbf{v}}, \ a = \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}} \cdot \widetilde{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{inc}}
\end{equation}
The whole linear equation system can be obtained through assembling. From above $L$ is the linear form and $a$ is the bilinear form. Weak formulation of (\ref{eq: equ}) is to search $\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{inc}}$ in $V$, such that the following holds,
\begin{equation}
a(\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}_{\text{inc}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{v}}) = L(\widetilde{\mathbf{v}}),\ \forall  \widetilde{\mathbf{v}} \in \hat{V}
\end{equation}
After solving this equation the fluctuation increment is obtained.

\subsection{Post-processing}
When it comes to post-processing, the extended strain is calculated first and the total energy of the material is expressed with (\ref{eq: strain energy}). Noticing (\ref{eq: decomp})
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}(\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}).
\end{equation}
This can be seen as a ``mapping" of fluctuation into the strain space. The total energy is formulated with $\Pi(\mathbf{F})$ or $\Pi(\overbar{\mathbf{F}},\widetilde{\mathbf{F}})$.

The actual local generalized stress for the extended stain is the derivative of local energy, namely
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: loc en}
\mathbf{P}_{i} = \dfrac{\partial \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}}.
\end{equation}
Then the averaged generalized stress is the average of the above formula. When the unit cell has edges with length one, the following integral over the domain is the averaged quantity,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: ave strs}
\mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{1}{V}\sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \mathbf{P}_{i} \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation}
This method can be implemented in FEniCS. However a more simple way of deriving is the formula,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: ave strs 2}
\mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\partial \tfrac{1}{V} \Pi(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \left( \dfrac{1}{V} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}} \right).
\end{equation}
Comparing (\ref{eq: ave strs 2}) and (\ref{eq: ave strs}) the following must hold,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: equality}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \left( \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}} \right) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \dfrac{\partial \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation}
For component number $n$ is independent of the extended strain $\mathbf{F}$, the sum over $n$ components could be extracted out. Then the interchange of integral and derivative needs to be shown, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: interchange}
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \left( \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}} \right) = \int \dfrac{\partial \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation}
Numerical experiments show that this equality holds. Moreover in this formulation the integral is calculated in the reference configuration, while the extended strain is in current configuration. This implies the integral and differentiation with respect to the extended strain is independent hence interchangeable. These two formulation also end with two different implementations in FEniCS.

Analogously the derivation of the averaged tangent moduli can be carried out in two different manners. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: tan mod}
\mathbb{C}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{1}{V} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \mathbb{C}_{i} \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}} = \dfrac{1}{V} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \dfrac{\partial^{2} \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}^{2}} \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}}.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: tan mod 2}
\mathbb{C}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\partial^{2} \tfrac{1}{V} \Pi(\mathbf{F})}{\partial \mathbf{F}^{2}} = \dfrac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \mathbf{F}^{2}} \left( \dfrac{1}{V} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \int \psi_{i}(\mathbf{F}) \myd{\mathbf{x}_{i}} \right)
\end{equation}

The next step is to derive the homogenized parameters required for the macro scale, i.e. effective tangent moduli. This tangent moduli is the derivative of averaged extended stress $\mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}}$ with respect to macro strain $\overbar{\mathbf{F}}$. $\mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}}$ is expressed with 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}} = \mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}} \left( \overbar{\mathbf{F}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{F}} \right).
\end{equation}
Hence the effective moduli is as follows,
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{C}_{\text{eff}} = \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{P}_{\text{avg}} \left( \overbar{\mathbf{F}}, \widetilde{\mathbf{F}} \right)}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}}
\end{equation}
Recalling (\ref{eq: ave strs 2}), the following formula holds, (using $\mathbf{F} = \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}$ and chain rule)
\[
\mathbb{C}_{\text{eff}} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}} \left( \dfrac{1}{V} \int_{\text{cell}} \mathbf{P} \myd{\mathbf{x}} \right) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{F}} \left( \dfrac{1}{V} \int_{\text{cell}} \mathbf{P} \myd{\mathbf{x}} \right) : \dfrac{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}} =  \left( \dfrac{1}{V} \int_{\text{cell}}  \mathbb{C} \myd{\mathbf{x}} \right) : \left( \mathbb{I} + \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}} \right)
\]
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: c eff}
\xrightarrow[ V = 1]{\text{unit cell}} \mathbb{C}_{\text{eff}} = \mathbb{C}_{\text{avg}} + \int_{\text{cell}}  \mathbb{C} : \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}} \myd{\mathbf{x}} 
\end{equation}
Expressing the second term numerically is the main task in implementation, which will be discussed in the next section.

\section{Details in Implementation}
The unit cell module is made up of three files, \texttt{cell\_geom.py}, \texttt{cell\_material.py}, \texttt{cell\_computation.py}. \texttt{cell\_material.py} defines the material in composites. Three material models are included in the material library, while user defined material can be also implemented in an easy manner. \texttt{cell\_geom.py} specifies the inclusions of the material as well as the periodic mapping. Meshes can be imported or generated within FEniCS. 3D and 2D unit cells are available. An inclusion could be circle in 2D or sphere in 3D. Rectangular inclusion and brick inclusion are also realized in the current state. Boundaries and corners of unit cells can be marked for imposing Neumann boundary condition. The main part of this module is \texttt{cell\_computation.py}, pre-processing, formulation and solving, and post-processing are contained in this file. 

\subsection{cell\_material.py}
In this file class and functions for material definition are involved. The main part of this file is the \texttt{class Material}. The definition of material starts with its energy function. This energy function receives invariants as the function arguments. Then one can instantiate a new material with an energy function and its parameters. Next one defines invariants and pass them into the already defined material. By calling the name of material (\texttt{\_\_call\_\_} is overrided) with the dependent functions, the instantiation of a material is complete.

Here we list the definition of Saint Venant-Kirchhoff Material

\begin{python}
def st_venant_kirchhoff(E_m, nu_m):
	# Material parameters
    mu = E_m / (2 * (1 + nu_m))
    lmbda = E_m * nu_m / ((1 + nu_m) * (1 - 2 * nu_m))

	# Energy function
    def psi(inv, lmbda, mu):
        return 0.5 * lmbda * (inv[0]) ** 2 + mu * inv[1]

	# Instantiation with energy function and material parameters
    svk = Material(psi, [lmbda, mu])

    def invariant1(F):
        dim = F.geometric_dimension()
        I = Identity(dim)
        C = F.T * F
        E = 0.5 * (C - I)
        return tr(E)

    def invariant2(F):
        dim = F.geometric_dimension()
        I = Identity(dim)
        C = F.T * F
        E = 0.5 * (C - I)
        return tr(E.T * E)
	
	# Feed the invariant generators
    svk.invariant_generator_append((0,), [invariant1, invariant2])

    return svk
\end{python}

And the usage of this code is illustrated here.
\begin{python}
from dolfin import *
from cell_material import st_venant_kirchhoff

mesh = UnitSquareMesh(2, 2)
VFS = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1)
w = Function(VFS)
F = grad(w)

E_m, nu_m = 10.0, 0.3
svk = st_venant_kirchhoff(E_m, nu_m)

svk([F])
\end{python}

\subsection{cell\_geom.py}
The main class of this file is \texttt{class UnitCell}. Its instance is instantiated with a FEniCS \texttt{mesh}, and inclusions can be passed at the initiation stage or by using the member method \texttt{set\_append\_inclusion()}. Another important method is \texttt{add\_mark\_boundary()}, which will mark the boundary facets, edges or corners for later formulation of boundary condition of the problem. Inclusions are added by first instantiating an object of an inclusion class, e.g. \texttt{class InclusionCircle}. Then pass it to the instance method \texttt{set\_append\_inclusion()}. The usage is shown below,

\begin{python}
from dolfin import *
from cell_geom import UnitCell

mesh = UnitSquareMesh(40, 40, 'crossed')
inc1 = InclusionCircle(2, (0.1, 0.1), 0.5)
inc_group = {'circle_inc1': inc1}

# Direct initiation with inclusion
cell = UnitCell(mesh, inc_group)

# Set and append inclusion
cell = UnitCell(mesh)
cell.set_append_inclusion(inc_group)
\end{python}

Another focus in this file is to define periodic mapping for unit cell. It is not trivial with FEniCS, as it has its own rule of defining mapping. For the two dimensional case we refer to the example in the FEniCS forum, while the three dimensional case needs more investigation of its internal mapping definition. For 2D case, the edges on coordinate axis are marked as reference edges, and other edges are then mapped onto these two edges. For 3D case, the main facets are marked, which are formed between the main axis. Edges and corners not on the main axis are filtered out. The mapping then is grouped into two different categories, edge mapping and facet mapping. Edges in the same direction should be mapped to the edge on the main axis, while facet mapping is simply between two opposite facets. Detailed realization of 3D case can be viewed in the module. Usage of this periodic mapping is as follows,

\begin{python}
from dolfin import *
from cell_geom import PeriodicBoundary_no_corner

a, b, c = 3, 6, 9
mesh_3d = UnitCubeMesh(a, b, c)

# 3 is for 3d
FS_3d = FunctionSpace(mesh_3d, 'CG', 1, constrained_domain=PeriodicBoundary_no_corner(3))
f = Function(FS_3d)
\end{python}

\subsection{cell\_computation.py}
This is the main part of the unit cell module. Pre-processing contains merging functions and splitting functions, generate the extended strain. Then it enters the formulation of Finite Element problem, which includes calculating total energy, imposing boundary conditions, bilinear and linear form formulation. With \texttt{comp\_fluctuation()} the fluctuation $\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}$ is obtained. Post-processing concentrates the calculation of extended strain, generalized stress, averaged extended strain, averaged generalized stress, averaged moduli, and effective tangent moduli. Plotting the result is also realized in this file.

In the pre-processing step, using \texttt{field\_merge()}, \texttt{field\_split()} or \texttt{set\_field()} makes the multi field modelling easy to handle. Macro extended strain should also be merged and split in the case of multi field modelling. All these steps are wrapped in \texttt{input()} method.

As for the formulation and solving step, the code is rather straightforward. The boundary conditions here are Dirichlet boundary condition for fluctuation at every corner of the unit cell.

There are much more techniques in the post-processing step. We refer the work in \citep{SchKei:2012:tho}. The essential part is to derive the formula for the term 
\[
\dfrac{\partial \widetilde{\mathbf{F}}}{\partial \overbar{\mathbf{F}}}
\]
The equilibrium of the disturbed system is built with
\[
\text{div} \left[ \mathbb{C} : \left( \Delta \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \Delta \widetilde{\mathbf{F}} \right) \right] = \mathbf{0}
\]
The weak form is given as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: wk disturb}
\int_{\text{cell}} \delta \widetilde{\mathbf{F}} : \mathbb{C} : \left( \Delta \overbar{\mathbf{F}} + \Delta \widetilde{\mathbf{F}} \right) \myd{\mathbf{x}} = 0
\end{equation}
Then we substitute all the quantities with discretized one and rewrite the equation in matrix. Noting that $\mathbf{w}_{h}$ as the discretized fluctuation, $\mathbf{L}$ as the matrix operator that transform the extended fluctuation into its extended stress, and $\mathbf{K}$ as the stiffness matrix, then the second term in (\ref{eq: c eff}) is expressed as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L}^{T} \cdot \dfrac{\Delta \mathbf{w}_{h}}{\Delta \overbar{\mathbf{F}}} 
\end{equation}
The vector fraction corresponds to the derivative. This fraction is arranged in the same way as Jacobian matrix, where the $\mathbf{L}$ operator is applicable and let the dimension of the equation match with the dimension of tangent moduli matrix. The above (\ref{eq: wk disturb}) can be transformed with the matrix notation as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{w}_{h} + \mathbf{L} \cdot \Delta \overbar{\mathbf{F}} = \mathbf{0}
\end{equation}
The overall expression of effective tangent moduli is then
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C}_{\text{eff}} = \mathbf{C}_{\text{avg}} - \mathbf{L}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{K}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{L}
\end{equation}

As for the implementation, the trick to obtain the corresponding matrices is to left or right multiply a function generated by a constant function space. For average merged moduli, the following form is used
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{C}_{\text{avg}} = \int_{\text{cell}} \delta \mathbf{F}_{ \text{test\_const}}: \mathbb{C} : \Delta \mathbf{F}_{\text{trial\_const}} \myd{\mathbf{x}}.
\end{equation}
The corresponding code for this expression is 
\begin{python}
# Trial and test function to multiply with
F_const_trial = TrialFunction(self.strain_const_FS)
F_const_test = TestFunction(self.strain_const_FS)

# Derivate in the test and trial function direction, the same with left and right multiply
dPi_dF = derivative(self.Pi, self.F_merge, F_const_test)
ddPi_dF = derivative(dPi_dF, self.F_merge, F_const_trial)
# Integral over the unit cell
C_avg = assemble(ddPi_dF)
\end{python}

The same trick applies to the second term of the effective tangent moduli, where constant trial function is chosen for $\overbar{\mathbf{F}}$. The implementation is as follows. 
\begin{python}
# Trial function
F_bar_trial = TrialFunction(self.strain_const_FS)
# F_w is the linear form generated from the fluctuation solving step
L2 = derivative(self.F_w, self.F_bar_merge, F_bar_trial)
B2 = assemble(L2)

# Sensitivity method is just for efficient implementation of calculating K\L
LTKL2 = self.sensitivity(B2)
\end{python}

\section{Documentation}
This unit cell module contains a Python documentation in the original code. Docstrings are used in the implementation. The format of docstrings is reStructuredText. A Sphinx documentation manual is generated for the module. Besides, the usage of this module is clarified with examples and the unittest cases are also included for testing the new functionalities.
