	abstract = {A variational formulation is employed to derive a micromechanics-based, explicit nonlocal constitutive equation relating the ensemble averages of stress and strain for a class of random linear elastic composite materials. For two-phase composites with any isotropic and statistically uniform distribution of phases (which themselves may have arbitrary shape and anisotropy), we show that the leading-order correction to a macroscopically homogeneous constitutive equation involves a term proportional to the second gradient of the ensemble average of strain. This nonlocal constitutive equation is derived in explicit closed form for isotropic material in the one case in which there exists a well-founded physical and mathematical basis for describing the material's statistics: a matrix reinforced (or weakened) by a random dispersion of nonoverlapping identical spheres. By assessing, when the applied loading is spatially-varying, the magnitude of the nonlocal term in this constitutive equation compared to the portion of the equation that relates ensemble average stresses and strains through a constant “overall” modulus tensor, we derive quantitative estimates for the minimum representative volume element (RVE) size, defined here as that over which the usual macroscopically homogeneous “effective modulus” constitutive models for composites can be expected to apply. Remarkably, for a maximum error of 5\% of the constant “overall” modulus term, we show that the minimum RVE size is at most twice the reinforcement diameter for any reinforcement concentration level, for several sets of matrix and reinforcement moduli characterizing large classes of important structural materials. Such estimates seem essential for determining the minimum structural component size that can be treated by macroscopically homogeneous composite material constitutive representations, and also for the development of a fundamentally-based macroscopic fracture mechanics theory for composites. Finally, we relate our nonlocal constitutive equation explicitly to the ensemble average strain energy, and show how it is consistent with the stationary energy principle.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates computational procedures for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structures of inelastic constituents undergoing small strains. The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites.

The metal matrices of nanocomposites involved include aluminum and magnesium. The processing approaches for nanocomposites can be classified into ex-situ and in-situ synthesis routes. The ex-situ ceramic nanoparticles are prone to cluster during composite processing and the properties of materials are lower than the theoretical values. Despite the fact of clustering, ex-situ nanocomposites reinforced with very low loading levels of nanoparticles exhibit higher yield strength and creep resistance than their microcomposite counterparts filled with much higher particulate content. Better dispersion of ceramic nanoparticles in metal matrix can be achieved by using appropriate processing techniques. Consequently, improvements in both the mechanical strength and ductility can be obtained readily in aluminum or magnesium by adding ceramic nanoparticles. Similar beneficial enhancements in mechanical properties are observed for the nanocomposites reinforced with in-situ nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {A simple physical model of 1-3 composite piezoelectrics is advanced for the material properties that are relevant to thickness-mode oscillations. This model is valid when the lateral spatial scale of the composite is sufficiently fine that the composite can be treated as an effective homogeneous medium. Expressions for the composite's material parameters in terms of the volume fraction of piezoelectric ceramic and the properties of the consituent piezoelectric ceramic and passive polymer are derived. A number of examples illustrate the implications of using piezocomposites in medical ultrasonic imaging transducers. While most material properties of the composite roughly interpolate between their values for pure polymer and pure ceramic, the composite's thickness-mode electromechanical coupling can exceed that of the component ceramic. This enhanced electromechanical coupling stems from partially freeeing the lateral clamping of the ceramic in the composite structure. Their higher coupling and lower acoustic impedence commend composites for medical ultrasonic imaging transducers. Our model also reveals that the composite's material properties cannot all be optimized simultaneoulsy; trade-offs must be made. Of most significance is the trade-off between the desired lower acoustic impedance and the undesired smaller electromechanical coupling that occurs as the volume fraction of piezoceramic is reduced.},

The resulting algorithmic two-scale transition procedure is implemented into an FE2-method, which allows us to compute macroscopic boundary value problems in consideration of attached microscopic representative volume elements. The challenge in the simulation of magneto-electromechanically coupled materials is the modeling of the complicated interactions between magnetical, electrical and mechanical quantities on both scales. A primer example for such interactions is given by magneto-electric composites. Thus, we apply the presented method to the two-scale simulation of a variety of versions of magneto-electric composites.

This model attempts to account for magnetic non-linearities and saturation by establishing a mechanism by which magnetic flux density is distributed within the composite material. Experimental evidence of the viscoelastic behaviour and magnetic properties of magnetorheological fluids and elastomers suggests that the assumptions made in the model development are reasonable.

	abstract = {An ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) consisting of a thin Nafion sheet, platinumplated on both faces, undergoes large bending motion when an electric field is applied across its thickness. Conversely, a voltage is produced across its faces when it is suddenly bent. A micromechanical model is developed which accounts for the coupled ion transport, electric field, and elastic deformation to predict the response of the IPMC, qualitatively and quantitatively. First, the basic three-dimensional coupled field equations are presented, and then the results are applied to predict the response of a thin sheet of an IPMC. Central to the theory is the recognition that the interaction between an imbalanced charge density and the backbone polymer can be presented by an eigenstress field (Nemat-Nasser and Hori, Micromechanics, Overall Properties of Heterogeneous Materials, 2nd Ed., Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1999). The constitutive parameter connecting the eigenstress to the charge density is calculated directly using a simple microstructural model for Nafion. The results are applied to predict the response of samples of IPMC, and good correlation with experimental data is obtained. Experiments show that the voltage induced by a sudden imposition of a curvature, is two orders of magnitude less than that required to produce the same curvature. The theory accurately predicts this result. The theory also shows the relative effects of different counter ions, e.g., sodium versus lithium, on the response of the composite to an applied voltage or a curvature.},

Each micro-mechanics theory is implemented through a matrix formulation in which the effective electroelastic moduli are conveniently represented by a 9 × 9 matrix. As in the corresponding uncoupled elastic and electric behavior, the dilute and Mori-Tanaka schemes return explicit estimates for the effective electroelastic moduli. The self consistent method, however, returns an implicit nonlinear algebraic matrix equation for the effective electroelastic moduli. The differential scheme formally results in a set of 81 coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the effective electroelastic moduli.

An appropriate micro-mechanical energy analysis is proposed leading to a damage evolution law that incorporates stiffness degradation, material softening, size effects, unilaterality, different fracture behaviors in tension and compression, induced anisotropy. The model also accounts for micro-crack nucleation and growth.

Finite element solutions for some numerical tests are presented in order to illustrate the ability of the new approach to describe known behaviors, like the localization of damage and size-dependence of the structural response.

	abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.

	abstract = {The paper presents new continuous and discrete variational formulations for the homogenization analysis of inelastic solid materials undergoing finite strains. The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of finite inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response, where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a distinct setting of multi-surface inelasticity and develop a numerical solution technique based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of finite elasticity to the incremental setting of finite inelasticity. Focussing on macro-deformation-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem for generalized standard materials at finite strains, where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed displacements, non-trivial periodic displacements and prescribed stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and develop numerical solution methods based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. Representative applications of the proposed minimization principles are demonstrated for a constitutive model of crystal plasticity and the homogenization problem of texture analysis in polycrystalline aggregates.

	abstract = {Soft matter electro-elastic (EE), magneto-elastic (ME) and magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) composites exhibit coupled material behavior at large strains. Examples are electro-active polymers and magneto-rheological elastomers, which respond by a deformation to applied electric or magnetic fields, and are used in advanced industrial environments as sensors and actuators. Polymer-based magneto-electric-elastic composites are a new class of tailor-made materials with promising future applications. Here, a magneto-electric coupling effect is achieved as a homogenized macro-response of the composite with electro-active and magneto-active constituents. These soft composite materials show different types of instability phenomena, which even might be exploited for future enhancement of their performance. This covers micro-structural instabilities, such as buckling of micro-fibers or particles, as well as material instabilities in the form of limit-points in the local constitutive response. Here, the homogenization-based scale bridging links long wavelength micro-structural instabilities to material instabilities at the macro-scale. This work outlines a comprehensive framework of an energy-based computational homogenization in electro-magneto-mechanics, which allows a tracking of postcritical solution paths such as those related to pull-in instabilities. It provides variational-based definitions of multiscale structural and material stability phenomena. The starting point is a minimization principle of averaged electromagneto-elastic energy, that is discretized by using electric and magnetic vector potentials. Next, computationally more effective representations based on scalar potentials are considered by a reformulation of the energy in terms of an averaged enthalpy functional. Structural stability is analyzed based on perturbations of the averaged energy, while local material stability is defined by a generalized quasi-convexity condition. It is shown that the incremental arrays which govern the stability criteria appear within the convenient enthalpy-based representation in a distinct diagonal form, containing mechanical and electro-magnetic partitions. Representative simulations demonstrate a tracking of inhomogeneous EE, ME and MEE composites, showing the development of postcritical zones in the microstructure and a possible unstable homogenized material response.

	doi = {10.1002/nme.4855},
	abstract = {Dielectric materials like electro-active polymers (EAPs) exhibit coupled electro-mechanical behavior at large strains. They respond by a deformation to an applied electrical field and are used in advanced industrial environments as sensors and actuators, for example, in robotics, biomimetics and smart structures. In field-activated or electronic EAPs, the electric activation is driven by Coulomb-type electrostatic forces, resulting in Maxwell stresses. These materials are able to provide finite actuation strains, which can even be improved by optimizing their composite microstructure. However, EAPs suffer from different types of instabilities. This concerns global structural instabilities, such as buckling and wrinkling of EAP devices, as well as local material instabilities, such as limit-points and bifurcation-points in the constitutive response, which induce snap-through and fine scale localization of local states. In this work, we outline variational-based definitions for structural and material stability, and design algorithms for accompanying stability checks in typical finite element computations. The formulation starts from stability criteria for a canonical energy minimization principle of electro-elasto-statics, and then shifts them over to representations related to an enthalpy-based saddle point principle that is considered as the most convenient setting for numerical implementation. Here, global structural stability is analyzed based on a perturbation of the total electro-mechanical energy, and related to statements of positive definiteness of incremental finite element tangent arrays. We base the local material stability on an incremental quasi-convexity condition of the electro-mechanical energy, inducing the positive definiteness of both the incremental electro-mechanical moduli as well as a generalized acoustic tensor. It is shown that the incremental arrays to be analyzed in the stability criteria appear within the enthalpy-based setting in a distinct diagonal form, with pure mechanical and pure electrical partitions. Applications of accompanying stability analyses in finite element computations are demonstrated by means of representative model problems. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The combination of thermal and mechanical loading expected in practice means that constitutive equations of metal matrix composites must be developed which deal with time-independent and time-dependent irreversible deformation. Also, the internal state of composites is extremely complicated which underlines the need to formulate macroscopic constitutive equations with a limited number of state variables which represent the internal state at the micro level. One available method for calculating the macro properties of composites in terms of the distribution and properties of the constituent materials is the method of homogenization whose formulation is based on the periodicity of the substructure of the composite. A homogenization procedure was developed which lends itself to the use of the finite element procedure. The efficiency of these procedures, to determine the macroscopic properties of a composite system from its constituent properties, was demonstrated utilizing an aluminum plate perforated by directionally oriented slits. The selection of this problem is based on the fact that, extensive experimental results exist, the macroscopic response is highly anisotropic, and that the slits provide very high stress gradients which severely test the effectiveness of the computational procedures. Furthermore, both elastic and plastic properties were investigated so that the application to practical systems with inelastic deformation should be able to proceed without difficulty. The effectiveness of the procedures was rigorously checked against experimental results and with the predictions of approximate calculations. Using the computational results it is illustrated how macroscopic constitutive equations can be expressed in forms of the elastic and limit load behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a new variational-based modeling and computational implementation of macroscopic continuum magneto-mechanics involving non-linear, inelastic material behavior, with a special focus on dissipative magnetostriction. It is based on a constitutive variational principle that optimizes a generalized incremental work function with respect to the internal state variables. In an incremental setting at finite time steps, this variational problem defines a quasi-hyper-magnetoelastic potential for the stresses and the magnetic induction, and incorporates energy storage as well as dissipative mechanisms. The existence of this potential further allows the incremental boundary-value problem of quasi-static inelastic magneto-mechanics to be recast into a principle of stationary incremental energy. The second focus of this paper is on the careful construction of the energy storage and dissipation functions for the model problem of hysteretic magnetostriction at the macroscopic level. It is then demonstrated that the proposed model is capable of predicting the ferromagnetic and field-induced strain hysteresis curves characteristic of magnetostrictive material response in good agreement with experiments. The numerical solution of the coupled non-linear boundary-value problem is based on a monolithic multi-field finite element implementation. As a consequence of the proposed incremental variational principle, the discretization of the multi-field problem appears in a compact symmetric format. In this sense, the proposed formulation provides a canonical framework for the simulation of boundary-value-problems in dissipative magnetostriction at the macro-level. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by application to relevant numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The necking process of a bar in an uniaxial tension test is influenced by the heat production due to inelastic deformations. Thus, for an analysis of this problem the thermomechanical coupling has to be considered. A finite element model and an associated algorithm are developed for this purpose. This computational tool allows the study of adiabatic processes as well as processes with heat flux. The analysis of the necking process of a perfectly cylindrical specimen shows that, in contrast to isothermal and adiabatic cases, no bifurcation occurs in the case where heat flux is considered.},

	doi = {10.1002/nme.2068},
	abstract = {In this paper, a multi-scale analysis method for heat transfer in heterogeneous solids is presented. The principles of the method rely on a two-scale computational homogenization approach which is applied successfully for the stress analysis of multi-phase solids under purely mechanical loading. The present paper extends this methodology to heat conduction problems. The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {An assessment of the stress tensors used currently for the modeling of partially saturated porous media is made which includes concepts like total stress, solid phase stress, and solid pressure. Thermodynamically constrained averaging theory is used to derive the solid phase stress tensor. It is shown that in the upscaling procedure the Hill conditions are satisfied, which is not trivial. The stress tensor is then compared to traditional stress measures. The physical meaning of two forms of solid pressure and of the Biot coefficient is clarified. Finally, a Bishop-Skempton like form of the stress tensor is obtained and a form of the total stress tensor that does not make use of the effective stress concept. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
