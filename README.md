[report directory](./report/). The theory is introduced in the part 1, 
while the concepts of implementation and numerical results are discussed 
in part 2.

## Sphinx Documentation

A detailed documentation is given in the [sphx_v1 directory](sphx_v1/build/html/).
You can visit the *index.html* in the build file.

## Examples

is what you are looking for. Both pdf manual and interactive ipynb files 
are included.

## Try-outs in IPython

There are some IPython notebooks testing the features and consistency in the [ipy_notebook directory](ipy_notebook/)

## Unittest

If new features are added, you can use files in [test](test/) to carry out unit 
tests.

__Please note that all the results are tested under python 2.7 and FEniCS 1.6.0__
